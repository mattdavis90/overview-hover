# Gnome Shell Extension - Overview Hover

Allows you to hover over a window in Gnome Shell's overview mode to make it active. When you leave overview mode the hovered window will now be your foxus.

The extension was inspired by MacOS; I use MacOS at work and missed this feature on Gnome Shell on my home laptop/PC.
