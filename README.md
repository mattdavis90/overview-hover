# Overview Hover - Gnome Shell Extension

An extension that aims to simulate the MacOS Mission Control experience.

Main Features

* Hover a window preview in Gnome Shell's overview to bring that window into focus
* Window focus won't change until you move your mouse
* Window focus will revert if your mouse leaves a preview
* Window focus doesn't change until you begin leaving overview

I've tried to model the behaviour to be as close to Mission Control as possible. If you find any weird edge cases or things don't work how you expect then please open an issue, or a PR.
